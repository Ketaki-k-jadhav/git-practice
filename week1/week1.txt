In week1, we will be using following very basic git commands

git init
git add
git status
git commit
git log

1. git init :

--Navigate into the working directory and do "git init".
--It will initialize empty "local" git repository in your working directory.

2. git add :

-- To add files/folders to staging area, do "git add file1 file2" or 
"git add folder1 folder2" or to add all files/folders at once, do "git add ."
--This will add your files/folders to staging area and not remote repository.

3. git status :

-- To check status of your files(removed, modified,added etc) that you have 
added to staging area.

4. git commit :
 
--now after making sure that you want to add all the files from staging area 
into remote repo, command is "git commit -m "short mssg" in present tense preferably".

5. git log :

--to see your commit messages and details.
